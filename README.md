As students staying on campus, supper orders are a regular part of hostel life. Students will likely order delivery for supper at least once a week, and often ask each other to help takeaway food when they order lunch as well.

Many students have also experienced the difficulties in collating orders. We usually open an order in group chats, and people will individually add their orders to these messages. However, we often run into a few issues. Firstly, students do not always know what the menu items are, since we usually order from a restaurant that is not on common platforms like GrabFood. Secondly, some orders sometimes get missed out since everyone is rushing to add their orders to the message, and the chat is full of multiple messages with the same order. Lastly, there are sometimes issues with our current payment system and some people who help to order do not always get their full money back.
